## Screens
### Indoors (Starting Screen)
- Pet the pet to increase happiness
### Kitchen (1 To The Right)
- Feed the pet to increase hunger (I know it doesn't make too much sense, but more hunger is a good thing)
### Outdoors (1 To The Left)

## Customization
### Changing Pet
1. Replace any sprite in PNGs with your own pet sprites, making sure to keep the EXACT SAME NAMES
   - I recommend using [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/) to create your sprites
   -  Make sure to export your sprites as Sprite-Sheet PNGs
   -  Pick a dimension that is a multiple of 128x128 for the best results
   -  Make sure to keep the same dimensions for all of the pet sprites
2. Run the program and enjoy your new pet!
