Monkey Mayhem is a fast-paced arcade game where you control a monkey trying to catch bananas while dodging rotten ones. 
As the game progresses, the bananas fall faster, making survival more challenging. 
Your goal is to collect as many bananas as possible while keeping your hearts intact. 
Every 10 points scored increases the banana speed by 10%, adding to the intensity. 
The game starts only when you press the spacebar, allowing you to get ready before the chaos begins. 
If you lose all your hearts, the screen goes black, and you must press space to restart with a fresh game.

Rules:
-Move the monkey left and right using the arrow keys.
-Catch normal and super bananas to increase your score.
-Avoid rotten bananasâ€”they reduce your hearts.
-Every 10 points scored increases the banana speed by 10%.
-If your hearts reach zero, the game ends.
-Press the spacebar to start the game or restart after a game over.
  
Monkey Mayhem tests your reflexes and endurance in an exciting challenge that keeps getting harder the longer you survive.
