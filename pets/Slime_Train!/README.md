# Getting the Best Slime
- Stay in the dungeon awhile, maybe you'll get some stuff from the salesman around
- Some say the witch has some potions for sale as well
- Don't die in the dungeon, 3 shots before your slime is done for good!
- If you're running low on health, maybe buying some food will help

## PS
- For some reason I can't use Slack, since the authorizing reaction doesn't work, so please use the email cayoub@bostonk12.org (Any tips to get Slack working would be appreciated as well)
