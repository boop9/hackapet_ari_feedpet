# A Ferret Adventure Game


Welcome to the Ferret Adventure Game! This game tests your ability to act quickly by having you play as a ferret who has to defeat their many enemies who are hell-bent on capturing them! 

You need to survive and defeat the final boss in order to free yourself from these hostile attackers.

### How to Play

Controls:
- Left and right buttons (or arrows on computer) move the ferret left and right
- The middle button (or upward arrow on computer) makes the ferret jump. This is also used to restart the game or revive yourself and get back to the most recent wave

1. The enemies' heads are very fragile, so jump on them as they get close in order to rid yourself of them
2. As waves progress, the enemies move faster and more of them appear
3. Defeat the final boss when it's vulnerable in order to win the game!

This is my first game using these libraries, let alone python, so I hope you enjoy!
