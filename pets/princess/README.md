# Princess

Princess is my little pet pink kitty. If you go all the way to the right of the screen, you can enter a nice little grassy area. To start the game, stand under the game controller icon and press the up button. The goal of the game is to guess the direction that Princess is going to pick by pressing either the left or right buttons. I know its a simple game, but it was inspired by a classic Tamagochi game and I plan on adding more to this such as the ability to feed Princess and to do other things with her.
