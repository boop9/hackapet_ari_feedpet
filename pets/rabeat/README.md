# Rabeat

Rabeat's goal is to be a collection of rabbit-themed rhythm games, to be played on a Tamagotchi Clone!

Because rabbits are the cutest animal, in my opinion, I decided to make this game that features them!

Music has always been a big part of my life, and rhythm games are my favorite games, so I decided to make a rhythm game. 
I was also inspired by Super Mario Party's Sound Stage.

## Setup
Run ```git clone https://github.com/Yoda-Flash/rabeat.git```
Enter the game directory, and then run ```python -m venv venv``` to create a virtual environment.
Run ```source venv/bin/activate``` to activate the virtual environment.

Run ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` to install the game requirements.

Finally, run ```python code/main.py``` to play the game!

For detailed instructions on how to play the game, read this [page](./how_to_play.md).
