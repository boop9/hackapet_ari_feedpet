# Sorry for Potato




A game about raising your potato. Designed for Hackclub's Hackapet




## Instructions




This game is all about keeping your potato healthy! The bars at the top represent your potato's three stats:
1. Water
2. Fertilizer
3. Bugs
4. Health




You can water or fertilize your plant by pressing the corresponding number key(1 and 2). If your water or fertilizer drops too low your potato will start losing health! If your potato is low on health, it will stop growing, and if it reaches 0, it will die!.




But be careful not to give your plant too much water or fertilizer, or you'll attract bugs! Any number of bugs is bad for your potato! Squash them by pressing 3.




If your potato has enough water, fertilizer, and no bugs it will heal over time.




With the current settings, the potato requires constant care and takes around 3 minutes to grow. For a more traditional tamagotchi experience, variables can be adjusted to need less care and take longer to grow.


## Future Work


### General
* Add title screen
* Make potato visibly grow 
 Code for this is mostly implemented, just need to make art assets
* Improve death and win screens
* Add potato saving
* Control game speed from interface
* Make potato sad as health decreases


### Hackapet specific
* Add button support
* Update images to be supported 
 From my understanding the current "fake" bmps with transparency won't work on the device. Images will need to be updated to real bmps with greenscreen transparency.
* Light up LED when potato needs attention
