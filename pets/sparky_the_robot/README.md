# Sparky the Robot ðŸ¤–
Sparky is your little robot companion! He can move around his home, and must be charged by playing a mini-game. It is a sequence-based memory game with 3 button: a sequence plays, and it must be repeated correctly. You can also interact with Sparky, but who knows how he'll react?  
# Controls
- Left and right buttons move Sparky
- While in the main room, the middle button is used to interact with Sparky
- While in the charging room and if Sparky is in front of the charging station, he will enter it and the charging mini-game will begin
- Press the middle button to proceed while in the starting or ending screens of the game, and use the three buttons to actually play the game

On PC the buttons are mapped to:
- Left button --> left arrow
- Middle button --> up arrow
- Right button --> right arrow

I'm not sure if this is necessary, but my name on slack is "Danielle". Also, I made this in a few days and am hoping to add way more features if I get a board!
