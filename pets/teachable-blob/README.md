A little virtual pet blob that can be taught to gather strawberries!
Instructions:
-Buttons are the numbers 1, 2, and 3.
-Use any button to hatch the egg.
-Button 1 changes the selection
-Button 2 selects things
-Button 3 exits activites
-Select the blob eating icon to feed your pet!
-Select the blob learning icon to teach your pet!
-When teaching your pet, there will be a bullet of goo going back and forth on a rainbow bar. Click 2 to stop the bullet. If you stop it at the exact center, you will get the red strawberry! If you miss by a little bit, you might get the green or pink strawberry instead. Every time you hit one of the strawberries, it becomes easier to hit one the next time.
-When an activity is selected, there will be a progress bar on the right for that activity. (for example, when eating is selected, there will be a hunger bar on the right.)
-If your blob gets too hungry, they will leave to find a better owner. Feed them before it happens!!
