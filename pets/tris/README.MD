# ðŸ”º Tris ðŸ”º 
A small game where you try to match blocks in pairs of two with the help of your pet, Tristan :3

 - Press the right key to rotate blocks clockwise
 - Press the left key to rotate blocks counterclockwise
 - Use the up arrow to restart (when game over'd)
 - When two blocks of the same color match, they'll both disappear
 - The game will gradually accelerate as more blocks spawn
 - If any side reaches 7 blocks, you lose :(
